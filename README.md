# Basic-File-Encryption-Decryption
This is a project to help me get ready for Cloud Security (university course). 

Project Details: Basic File Encryption/Decryption
Goal:
Create a program in Java that:
1.	Reads a text file.
2.	Applies a simple encryption method (e.g., Caesar cipher).
3.	Writes the encrypted output to another file.
4.	Provides a decryption option to reverse the process.
Key Features:
•	Input: User specifies the file to encrypt/decrypt and the shift key for the cipher.
•	Output: Encrypted/Decrypted text is written to a new file.
•	Options: User can choose between encryption or decryption.
Skills Covered:
•	File handling.
•	String manipulation.
•	Loops and conditionals.
•	Basic command-line interaction (optional).
Deadline:
Two weeks from today: December 15, 2024.
Tasks to Complete:
1.	Day 1-3: Learn or review file handling in Java.
o	Practice reading and writing text files.
o	Ensure your development environment is set up.
2.	Day 4-7: Implement basic Caesar cipher logic.
o	Create functions for encryption and decryption.
3.	Day 8-10: Integrate file handling and encryption logic.
o	Allow the program to read from and write to files.
o	Test using small text files.
4.	Day 11-13: Add a user-friendly menu for interaction.
o	Let users choose encryption or decryption, input shift key, etc.
5.	Day 14: Final testing and polish.
