#Why this works:
#Eclipse files: .project, .classpath, and .settings/ are configuration files created by Eclipse that you usually don’t need to track in Git.
#Compiled files: Java class files (*.class) are generated when you compile your .java code, so you don’t need to store them in Git.
#IDE-specific files: Files like .idea/ (for IntelliJ IDEA) or .vscode/ (for Visual Studio Code) are project-specific settings that are not useful for other developers working with the project.
